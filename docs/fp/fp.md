# 2-1. SOLID Principles with FP (Functional Programming) Examples

- Learn SOLID principles with FP (Functional Programming) examples.
- Examples presented here are not strictly FP, but refers to a style in which:
  - Has no ES6 Classes
  - Has no "this"
  - Uses "Factory Patterns" (using `Object.create`) instead of `new`.
  - Uses prototypal inheritances to define variants of the original.
- Or, in another word, it follows the pattern known as [Crockford's method](https://www.crockford.com/javascript/prototypal.html).
